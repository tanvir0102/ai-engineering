PRIOR ANALYSIS SUMMARY (from 2025-03-13):
- Architecture: monolith, Django 4.2, PostgreSQL 14
- Key coupling points: auth and billing share the User model directly
- Identified debt: payment_service.py has 3 untested code paths
- Recommended next steps: extract billing into separate bounded context

NOTE: This summary is from 2 days ago. The codebase has since been updated.
Please treat these as hypotheses to validate, not established facts.
Re-explore the current file structure before acting on these findings.
